This code challenge is a web application that allows users to browse movies, view movie details, and purchase tickets which has the following features:
- *Movie List*: Browse through the list of available movies.
- *Movie Details*: View detailed information about each movie, including title, description, runtime, showtime, available tickets, and poster.
- *Buy Tickets*: Purchase tickets for movies directly from the web application.
- *Trailer Modal*: Watch trailers in a full-screen modal for an immersive experience.


I have used the following technologies for my code:
-*HTML*: Used for structuring the web pages.
- *CSS*: Used for styling the web pages, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- *JavaScript*: Provides interactivity and dynamic content for the web pages.
- *JSON Server*: Acts as a mock backend server to store and retrieve movie data.


the following tasks can be performed by the application:

1. *Browse Movies*: The list of available movies is displayed on the left sidebar. Scroll through the list to find movies you're interested in.

2. *View Movie Details*: Click on any movie in the list to view its details. The movie details will be displayed in the main section, including the poster, title, description, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.

3. *Buy Tickets*: To purchase tickets for a movie, click the "Buy Ticket" button. The available tickets count will decrease, and the button will be disabled if the movie is sold out.

4. *Watch Trailers*: To watch a trailer, click the "Watch Trailer" button. The trailer will be displayed in a modal that covers the screen for an immersive experience.
